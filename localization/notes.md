the high accuracy means from 3 to 10 centimeters error

accuracy of gps 1 to 10 meters and sometimes from 10 to 50 mters

so we measure the distances to the static objects using sensors like lidars and radars in the local coordinate system 

to know where you are in the map we have the map and the map has its own global coordinate system so we have to match the measurments in the local coor system with global co-or system  (the transformation ) this transformation should be as accurate as possible wiht in 10 centeminter or less 

if we could do this correctly we solve the localization issue
